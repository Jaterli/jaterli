# Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Full Stack Development and another in Blockchain Development. Here, you will find exercises and small projects that I will be working on throughout my studies. This space will be my lab for experimentation and learning, where I will be applying and refining the skills and knowledge I acquire.

I am currently developing my personal blog where I post about topics and projects related to the master's programs I am studying. You can visit it at https://jaterli.netlify.app


Thanks for visiting and feel free to explore my repositories!
