# Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Full Stack Development and another in Blockchain Development. Here, you will find exercises and small projects that I will be working on throughout my studies. This space will be my lab for experimentation and learning, where I will be applying and refining the skills and knowledge I acquire.

Thanks for visiting and feel free to explore my repositories!
